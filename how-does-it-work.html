      <h2>SimpC</h2>
      <p>
        The C like statements are interpreted by JavaScript, right in the
        browser. It's <em>really</em> simplistic. It only supports
        <code>int</code> and pointers to <code>int</code> (arbitrary number of
        them). There is no concept of <code>if</code>/<code>for</code>, no
        functions, no structs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The aim is to understand pointers, not build a C interpreted in the
        browser :)
      </p>
      <h2>Memory representation</h2>
      <p>
        If you enable "Show raw bits", you will see how <code>int</code> and
        pointers are usually stored in memory. <code>int</code> are stored as
        two's complement (have a look at <code>-1</code>), and pointers are just
        positive numbers all the time, so they are just a binary number
        corresponding to the memory cell.
